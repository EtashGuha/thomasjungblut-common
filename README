Hey all,

this is my code-sink for mainly java files.

Have fun to browse through many things for:

- Datastructures & Algorithms
- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Hama
- Graph algorithms
- Clustering
- Machine learning
- Matrix and Vector stuff
- JCuda experiments

Since I am Apache committer, I consider everything inside of this repository 
licensed by Apache 2.0 license, although I haven't put the usual header into the source files.

Sorry for the bad package layout, I decided very late to add testcases, 
I haven't thought that this repository will grow so big over time.

Package Layout:

/src -> raw source code.
/test -> testcases for the code in /src.
/files -> reserved directory for files in examples or ignored paths for output of applications.
/jcuda -> the cuda 3rd party libs for the de.jungblut.math.cuda package
/lib -> the 3rd party libs needed (if I have time I will switch to maven)
