Hey all,

this is my code-sink for mainly java files.

Have fun to browse through many things for:

- Datastructures
- Apache Hadoop
- Apache Hama
- Graph algorithms
- Clustering
- Machine learning
- Matrix Multiplication

For the math.matrix package you'll need Java7, because it uses the fork/join framework.
